Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.

1. **Project Context**:
   - This project is focused on building multimodal data assistant with a chatbot experience with data in Elasticsearch.
   - The primary programming language is TypeScript and python, and the codebase is structured using a modular approach.
   - The assistant should be able to freely chat to the user
    - check and understand possible datasets within elasticsearch.
    - understand and manipulate Elasticsearch queries and data.

2. **Coding Guidelines**:
   - Follow the existing code style and conventions used in the project.
   - Follow the existing folder structure and naming conventions.
   - Write clear, maintainable code with appropriate comments and documentation.
   - The code should be modular and reusable, with a clear separation of concerns.
   - Avoid large monolithic components; break them down into smaller, reusable pieces.
   - Ensure that all new code is covered by tests, and existing tests are not broken by changes.
   - Optimize for performance and efficiency, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex queries.
   - Prioritize security and data privacy, particularly when handling user data or sensitive information.
